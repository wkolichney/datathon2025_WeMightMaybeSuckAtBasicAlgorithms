# Files go here

### Some of these files are simply context. As of Wednesday, I've added the projected rail file. This uses the exponential growth of half a percent until 2040, as per the infrastructure report card that got me thinking about this project. I believe most columns are self-explanatory in that file, save for one.

#### if_trucks column in the projected rail Excel file.

This column will likely need to be deleted after some real research. I made the assumption that the VA rail system can only handle 2022's number of freight carloads. Any growth from there was treated as "too much" for the rail line, and additional cars were "converted" into trucks on the highway. However, this assumption is false. In the report on VA infrastructure, rail lines from Richmond to DC can handle incoming demand over the years, and I don't know how we can figure out what the other rail lines can handle, or figure out how many freight car loads even run on specific rail lines (granted there are only 10, but I still don't think the data is this granular)
