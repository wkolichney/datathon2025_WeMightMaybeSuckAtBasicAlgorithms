## Project Idea so far

One freight train car takes 3.4 trucks off the highway. VA's freight train demand grows half a percent yearly (projected up to 2040). Rail lines from Richmond to DC can handle this, but the rest of the state lines can't. How much spill over of this unmanageable demand will result in trucks on the road?

Ex: 2025's # of freight car flow = 4000. In 2040, this would be 4300. If we can only handle 4000, this would result in 1,020 more trucks on the highways

If the new lanes from VDOT's infrastructure project can handle the increased number of trucks - Good! 
<br>
If they can't, gotta put more into rails

#### Why this project may be a good deliverable

"Fund a rigorous study of the economic and environmental life-cycle costs and
benefits of adding new freight capacity on rail versus roadway expansion in the I-81 Corridor"

Our analysis may be a good way to see if roads can handle more trucks, or if we should beef up rail lines.
